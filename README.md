# Phishing-Spammer
A simple tool to detect Phishing and also spams them

The tool uses different apis to detect Phising Links while browsing there will be a option to spam the phishing website.
This tool collects webdata (only detected phishing links) to build a database. you can also report a website for phising by modifing the database.json file.

I provide a python and a ruby script. both does the same.

## Hotkeys for Spamming :

START_HOTKEY = "ctrl+alt+s"

Hotkey to fill in values and submit
FILL_HOTKEY = "ctrl+alt+f"

Hotkey to stop the script
STOP_HOTKEY = "ctrl+alt+x"
